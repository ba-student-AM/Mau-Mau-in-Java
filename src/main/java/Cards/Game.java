/* Rules of the game: 
 * - declaredCard has TYPE "SIEBEN" ? Player must draw two cards from drawStack - next Player can just add a card with the same SUIT 
 * 
 * - declaredCard has TYPE "ASS"    ? Player can play another card
 * - declaredCard has TYPE "ACHT"   ? Next Player is skipped - we go from player 1 to Player 3, for two players, the effect is practically the same as an "ASS"
 * - declaredCard has TYPE "BUBE"   ? Current player gets a Pop-Up to select which SUIT he wishes for - his selection overwrites the current declaredSUIT
